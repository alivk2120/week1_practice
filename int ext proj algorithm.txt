step 1: read internal marks
step 2: read external marks
step 3: read project marks
step 4: check if internal marks greater than 50 and external marks greater than 50 and project marks greater than 50
step 5: project score=(project marks*70)/100
step 6: external score=(external marks*20)/100
step 7: internal score = (internal marks*10)/100
step 8: add project score, external score and internal score and store in total
step 9: if total is greater than 90
step 10: display grade A
step 11: if total is greater than 70 and less than 90
step 12: display grade B
step 13: if total is gretaer than 50 and less than 70
step 14: dispaly grade C
